// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
//  The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
//  It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
//   Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs,
//    such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s 
//   returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
